Amazon Electronics Sales Performance Dashboard
Project Overview
This project addresses the Amazon CEO's request for a dashboard that moves beyond traditional KPIs to uncover unexpected patterns and provide actionable insights into the Electronics Division's sales performance. Despite high sales volume, revenue per order is shrinking, raising concerns about profit leakage due to discounting strategies.

Problem Statement
"We’re drowning in data and KPIs. Show me something I don’t know. Make me rethink how we’re selling electronics."

Mission: Build a dashboard that covers core KPIs and adds surprising insights to provoke discussion and guide strategic decisions.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Core KPIs (Baseline)
Revenue per Category: Analysis of actual revenue (with discounts) versus potential revenue (without discounts) for each product category.
% Sales Driven by Discounts vs. Full Price: Breakdown of revenue sources to understand reliance on discounts.
Best Sellers Contribution to Revenue: The percentage of total revenue generated by products marked as 'Best Sellers'.
Ratings vs. Sales Correlation: Correlation between product ratings and sales volume.
Provocative Add-Ons (Unexpected Patterns)
Dead Weight Products: Products receiving heavy discounts but showing no significant sales lift.
Trust Gap: Discrepancies between high product ratings and low sales, or low ratings and high sales.
Discount Addiction: Assessment of whether customers are primarily purchasing only when discounts exceed a certain threshold (e.g., 40%).
Sustainability Effect: Analysis of sales performance for eco-tagged products versus non-eco-tagged products.
Category Subsidies: Identification of product categories heavily reliant on discounts to drive sales.
Time-to-Delivery Impact: Examination of how delivery duration affects sales, especially across different product categories.
Summary of Key Findings
Core KPIs
Revenue per Category: Laptops led in both actual ( 313.4M)andpotential( 350.8M) revenue, indicating a high-value category with significant discount impact.
Sales Mix: 40.05% of total revenue came from discounted sales, while 59.95% came from full-price sales.
Best Sellers: 'Best Seller' products contribute 8.38% to total revenue, suggesting they are a steady but not overwhelming source of income.
Ratings vs. Sales: A very weak positive correlation (Pearson: 0.14) was found between product ratings and units purchased, implying that high ratings alone do not guarantee high sales.
Unexpected Patterns
Dead Weight Products: Identified 1,950 products with heavy discounts (>8.49%) but low sales (<100 units purchased), highlighting potential inventory and pricing inefficiencies.
Trust Gap:
High-Rated, Low-Sales: 1,885 products had high ratings (>=4.70) but very low sales (0 units purchased).
Low-Rated, High-Sales: 1,483 products had low ratings (<=4.20) but high sales (>=300 units purchased).
Discount Addiction: Very high discounts (>=40%) contributed minimally (4.09% of units, 2.52% of revenue) to overall sales, indicating customers are not solely driven by extreme discounts.
Sustainability Impact: Eco-tagged products, while fewer in number, demonstrate a disproportionately higher revenue contribution (12.15% of total revenue vs. 7.13% of units), suggesting a willingness among consumers to pay more for sustainable options.
Category Subsidies: 'Wearables' (25.08%), 'Networking' (15.68%), and 'Headphones' (15.65%) showed the highest discount reliance, indicating these categories often require substantial discounts to stimulate sales.
Time-to-Delivery: A negligible overall correlation (-0.00) between delivery duration and units purchased, implying that for the dataset as a whole, delivery time is not a primary factor influencing purchases.
Actionable Insights & Strategic Recommendations
Optimize Discount and Inventory Management:

Address Dead Weight: Investigate the 1,950 'dead weight' products. Consider phasing out persistent underperformers or re-evaluating their pricing and marketing strategies rather than continuously applying heavy discounts. This could free up capital and reduce holding costs.
Refine Discounting Strategies: Since very high discounts aren't driving significant overall sales, re-evaluate the threshold and application of discounts. Focus on strategic, targeted promotions rather than broad, deep cuts that may erode profit margins without a proportional sales lift.
Investigate and Bridge the Trust Gap:

High-Rated, Low-Sales Products: For the 1,885 high-rated but low-selling products, explore potential marketing visibility issues (e.g., poor SEO, insufficient advertising, lack of product discoverability) or pricing strategy mismatches. These products represent untapped potential.
Low-Rated, High-Sales Products: For the 1,483 low-rated but high-selling products, conduct a deeper analysis into product quality, customer service, or unmet expectations. While these products are selling well, improving their rating could enhance brand loyalty and reduce potential negative feedback loops.
Leverage Sustainability as a Value Driver:

Expand Eco-Tagged Offerings: Given the strong revenue contribution of eco-tagged products, actively seek to expand this segment. Highlight sustainability features in marketing to appeal to environmentally conscious consumers who are willing to pay a premium.
Premium Pricing Opportunities: Explore opportunities for premium pricing or reduced discounting on eco-tagged products, as consumer demand appears resilient even without deep discounts.
Strategic Category Review:

Discount-Reliant Categories: Conduct a deep dive into 'Wearables', 'Networking', and 'Headphones'. Understand if their high discount reliance is due to market saturation, competitive pricing, or perceived value issues. Strategies could include product differentiation, bundling, or emphasizing unique features over price cuts.
